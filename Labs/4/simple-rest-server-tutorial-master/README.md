# Simple REST server tutorial

## Dependencies

```
pip3 install pillow jsonpickle
```

## Overview

This is a simple example of a REST server using both GET and POST
queries written using the Flask package. This is not intended to be an
example of good programming practice or secure coding examples.

## Sample Queries

### Simple GET
```
 curl --verbose http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/add/10/20
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:5000...

> GET /api/add/10/20 HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:5000
> User-Agent: curl/7.71.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
